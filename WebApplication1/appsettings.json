/*Configuration Sources in ASP.NET core
//file sources such as this and the appsettings.Development.json and others,user Secrets(no clue lol :( )
  environment variables with the tag "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT"
  (development,staging,production and others in the launchSettings or other places)
  , commandline arguments with cli for VS the last is the most powerful and the first is the weakest
  the CreateDefaultBuilder in the program.cs is the method that sets the order of the configuration from cli
  to the weakest which is the file source appsettings.json and the appsettings.Development.json
  and you can change the order because ASP.net core is opensource*/
