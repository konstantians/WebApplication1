<!-- viewstart file is executed before any individual view -->
<!-- it allows to set the layout without having to repeat it in every single page-->
<!-- it is very useful for mantainance reasons -->
<!-- viewstart files are hierarchical , and they can be placed anywhere -->
<!-- the viestart file in a sub directory for example here home or shared override -->
<!-- the viewstart file in the views folder -->
<!-- and if we set the layout manually or we set it to null in a file for example -->
<!-- Details then it uses that layout or no layout(null) overriding the viestart file-->
