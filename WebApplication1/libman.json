//libman.json(library manager manifest file) shows all the outside libraries(like bootstrap,jquery)
//which the user has download , instead of the graphical interface which a user can use
//right click on project(webapplication1), add and choose client side library, you can use
//the library manager immediately

{
  "version": "1.0", //version of library manage
  "defaultProvider": "cdnjs", //you can use 3 other options i am not certain what the are
  "libraries": [ //the libraries
    {
      "library": "twitter-bootstrap@4.5.0", //name of the library
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/bootstrap/" //where it should be installed
    },
    {
      "library": "jquery@3.5.1", //to update click on the string jquery and then click on the light bulb
      //or write it yourself
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/jquery/"
    },
    {
      "library": "jquery-validate@1.19.2",
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/validation/"
    },
    {
      "library": "jquery-validation-unobtrusive@3.2.11",
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/validationUnobtrusive/"
    }
  ]
}

//a good practise is to put all the outside libraries in the wwwroot/lib file
//to clean the libraries right click on the libman.json and choose clean client-side libraries
//to restore them right click on the libman.json file and choose restore client-side libraries
//to delete the configuration(dont know why but ok) delete libman.json or delete everything it has inside
